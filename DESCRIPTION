Description: Functions to start, configure and manage nodes of an Amazon Web Services Compute Cluster. 
        The main function configures the nodes with passwordless ssh between nodes, allows the user 
        to send necessary files to the nodes, install (or update) R packages and execute Linux system 
        commands on all compute nodes.  Helper functions allow the user to copy additional files 
        (e.g. script files or results from analyses) to and from their local machine, log on to any node, 
        kill nodes of the cluster, or terminate all running instances.
SystemRequirements: Amazon EC2 API Tools (http://aws.amazon.com/developertools/) with
        Java version 5 (or later) compatible Java Runtime Environment (JRE).  See
        EC2 Getting Started with the Command Line Tools guide (http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/2010-06-15/UserGuide/).
        A secure shell application (e.g. OpenSSH - www.openssh.com/) is also required for internal system calls to 'ssh' and 'scp'.
